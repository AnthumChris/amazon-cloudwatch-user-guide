| CloudWatch Container Insights isn't released yet\. It's in preview and is subject to change\. The preview is open to all AWS accounts\. You do not need to request access\. | 

If you use Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes or other Kubernetes \(K8s\) platforms on Amazon EC2, you can use CloudWatch Container Insights to collect, aggregate, and summarize metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices\. The metrics include utilization for resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network\. Container Insights also provides diagnostic information, such as container restart failures, to help you isolate issues and resolve them quickly\. You can also set CloudWatch alarms on metrics that Container Insights collects\.

The metrics that Container Insights collects are available in CloudWatch automatic dashboards\. You can view further container data with CloudWatch Logs Insights\.

Container Insights uses a containerized version of the CloudWatch agent to discover all the running containers in a cluster and collect performance data at every layer of the performance stack\. Operational data is collected as *performance log events*\. These are entries that use a structured JSON schema that enables high\-cardinality data to be ingested and stored at scale\. From this data, CloudWatch creates higher\-level aggregated metrics at the cluster, node, pod, and service level as CloudWatch metrics\.
