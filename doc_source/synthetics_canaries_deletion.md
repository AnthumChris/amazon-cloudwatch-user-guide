When you delete a canary, resources used and created by the canary are not automatically deleted\. After you delete a canary that you do not intend to use again, you should also delete the following:
+ The Lambda functions and layers used by this canary\. These have the prefix `cwsyn-MyCanaryName`\.
+ The CloudWatch alarms created for this canary\. These alarms have a name of `Synthetics-Alarm-MyCanaryName`\.
+ Amazon S3 objects and buckets, such as the canary's results location and artifact location
+ IAM roles created for the canary\. These have the name ` role/service-role/CloudWatchSyntheticsRole-MyCanaryName `
+ CloudWatch Logs log groups created for the canary\. These logs groups have the following names: `/aws/lambda/cwsyn-MyCanaryName` 

Before you delete a canary, you may want to view the canary details and make note of this information for that canary, so that you can delete the correct resources after deleting the canary\.
