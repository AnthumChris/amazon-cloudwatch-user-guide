| --- | --- | 
| AvailabilityZone |  Filter the metric data by Availability Zone\.  | 
| LoadBalancer |  Filter the metric data by load balancer\. Specify the load balancer as follows: app/*load\-balancer\-name*/*1234567890123456* \(the final portion of the load balancer ARN\)\.  |

| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| ActiveFlowCount |  The total number of concurrent TCP flows \(or connections\) from clients to targets\. This metric includes connections in the SYN\_SENT and ESTABLISHED states\. TCP connections are not terminated at the load balancer, so a client opening a TCP connection to a target counts as a single flow\. **Statistics**: The most useful statistics are `Average`, `Maximum`, and `Minimum`\.  | 
| ConsumedLCUs |  The number of load balancer capacity units \(LCU\) used by your load balancer\. You pay for the number of LCUs that you use per hour\. For more information, see [Elastic Load Balancing Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/pricing/)\.  |

| UnHealthyHostCount |  The number of targets that are considered unhealthy\. **Statistics**: The most useful statistics are `Average`, `Maximum`, and `Minimum`\.  | 

## Metric Dimensions for Network Load Balancers<a name="load-balancer-metric-dimensions-nlb"></a>

To filter the metrics for your load balancer, use the following dimensions\.


| Dimension | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| AvailabilityZone |  Filter the metric data by Availability Zone\.  | 
| LoadBalancer |  Filter the metric data by load balancer\. Specify the load balancer as follows: net/*load\-balancer\-name*/*1234567890123456* \(the final portion of the load balancer ARN\)\.  | 
| TargetGroup |  Filter the metric data by target group\. Specify the target group as follows: targetgroup/*target\-group\-name*/*1234567890123456* \(the final portion of the target group ARN\)\.  | 

## Classic Load Balancer Metrics<a name="loadbalancing-metrics-clb"></a>

The `AWS/ELB` namespace includes the following metrics\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| BackendConnectionErrors |  The number of connections that were not successfully established between the load balancer and the registered instances\. Because the load balancer retries the connection when there are errors, this count can exceed the request rate\. Note that this count also includes any connection errors related to health checks\. **Reporting criteria**: There is a nonzero value **Statistics**: The most useful statistic is `Sum`\. Note that `Average`, `Minimum`, and `Maximum` are reported per load balancer node and are not typically useful\. However, the difference between the minimum and maximum \(or peak to average or average to trough\) might be useful to determine whether a load balancer node is an outlier\. **Example**: Suppose that your load balancer has 2 instances in us\-west\-2a and 2 instances in us\-west\-2b, and that attempts to connect to 1 instance in us\-west\-2a result in back\-end connection errors\. The sum for us\-west\-2a includes these connection errors, while the sum for us\-west\-2b does not include them\. Therefore, the sum for the load balancer equals the sum for us\-west\-2a\.  | 
| HealthyHostCount |  The number of healthy instances registered with your load balancer\. A newly registered instance is considered healthy after it passes the first health check\. If cross\-zone load balancing is enabled, the number of healthy instances for the `LoadBalancerName` dimension is calculated across all Availability Zones\. Otherwise, it is calculated per Availability Zone\. **Reporting criteria**: There are registered instances **Statistics**: The most useful statistics are `Average` and `Maximum`\. These statistics are determined by the load balancer nodes\. Note that some load balancer nodes might determine that an instance is unhealthy for a brief period while other nodes determine that it is healthy\. **Example**: Suppose that your load balancer has 2 instances in us\-west\-2a and 2 instances in us\-west\-2b, us\-west\-2a has 1 unhealthy instance, and us\-west\-2b has no unhealthy instances\. With the `AvailabilityZone` dimension, there is an average of 1 healthy and 1 unhealthy instance in us\-west\-2a, and an average of 2 healthy and 0 unhealthy instances in us\-west\-2b\.  | 
|  `HTTPCode_Backend_2XX`, `HTTPCode_Backend_3XX`, `HTTPCode_Backend_4XX`, `HTTPCode_Backend_5XX`  |  \[HTTP listener\] The number of HTTP response codes generated by registered instances\. This count does not include any response codes generated by the load balancer\. **Reporting criteria**: There is a nonzero value **Statistics**: The most useful statistic is `Sum`\. Note that `Minimum`, `Maximum`, and `Average` are all 1\. **Example**: Suppose that your load balancer has 2 instances in us\-west\-2a and 2 instances in us\-west\-2b, and that requests sent to 1 instance in us\-west\-2a result in HTTP 500 responses\. The sum for us\-west\-2a includes these error responses, while the sum for us\-west\-2b does not include them\. Therefore, the sum for the load balancer equals the sum for us\-west\-2a\.  | 
| HTTPCode\_ELB\_4XX |  \[HTTP listener\] The number of HTTP 4XX client error codes generated by the load balancer\. Client errors are generated when a request is malformed or incomplete\. **Reporting criteria**: There is a nonzero value **Statistics**: The most useful statistic is `Sum`\. Note that `Minimum`, `Maximum`, and `Average` are all 1\. **Example**: Suppose that your load balancer has us\-west\-2a and us\-west\-2b enabled, and that client requests include a malformed request URL\. As a result, client errors would likely increase in all Availability Zones\. The sum for the load balancer is the sum of the values for the Availability Zones\.  | 
| HTTPCode\_ELB\_5XX |  \[HTTP listener\] The number of HTTP 5XX server error codes generated by the load balancer\. This count does not include any response codes generated by the registered instances\. The metric is reported if there are no healthy instances registered to the load balancer, or if the request rate exceeds the capacity of the instances \(spillover\) or the load balancer\. **Reporting criteria**: There is a nonzero value **Statistics**: The most useful statistic is `Sum`\. Note that `Minimum`, `Maximum`, and `Average` are all 1\. **Example**: Suppose that your load balancer has us\-west\-2a and us\-west\-2b enabled, and that instances in us\-west\-2a are experiencing high latency and are slow to respond to requests\. As a result, the surge queue for the load balancer nodes in us\-west\-2a fills and clients receive a 503 error\. If us\-west\-2b continues to respond normally, the sum for the load balancer equals the sum for us\-west\-2a\.  | 
| Latency |  \[HTTP listener\] The total time elapsed, in seconds, from the time the load balancer sent the request to a registered instance until the instance started to send the response headers\. \[TCP listener\] The total time elapsed, in seconds, for the load balancer to successfully establish a connection to a registered instance\. **Reporting criteria**: There is a nonzero value **Statistics**: The most useful statistic is `Average`\. Use `Maximum` to determine whether some requests are taking substantially longer than the average\. Note that `Minimum` is typically not useful\. **Example**: Suppose that your load balancer has 2 instances in us\-west\-2a and 2 instances in us\-west\-2b, and that requests sent to 1 instance in us\-west\-2a have a higher latency\. The average for us\-west\-2a has a higher value than the average for us\-west\-2b\.  | 
| RequestCount |  The number of requests completed or connections made during the specified interval \(1 or 5 minutes\)\. \[HTTP listener\] The number of requests received and routed, including HTTP error responses from the registered instances\. \[TCP listener\] The number of connections made to the registered instances\. **Reporting criteria**: There is a nonzero value **Statistics**: The most useful statistic is `Sum`\. Note that `Minimum`, `Maximum`, and `Average` all return 1\. **Example**: Suppose that your load balancer has 2 instances in us\-west\-2a and 2 instances in us\-west\-2b, and that 100 requests are sent to the load balancer\. There are 60 requests sent to us\-west\-2a, with each instance receiving 30 requests, and 40 requests sent to us\-west\-2b, with each instance receiving 20 requests\. With the `AvailabilityZone` dimension, there is a sum of 60 requests in us\-west\-2a and 40 requests in us\-west\-2b\. With the `LoadBalancerName` dimension, there is a sum of 100 requests\.  | 
| SpilloverCount |  The total number of requests that were rejected because the surge queue is full\. \[HTTP listener\] The load balancer returns an HTTP 503 error code\. \[TCP listener\] The load balancer closes the connection\. **Reporting criteria**: There is a nonzero value **Statistics**: The most useful statistic is `Sum`\. Note that `Average`, `Minimum`, and `Maximum` are reported per load balancer node and are not typically useful\. **Example**: Suppose that your load balancer has us\-west\-2a and us\-west\-2b enabled, and that instances in us\-west\-2a are experiencing high latency and are slow to respond to requests\. As a result, the surge queue for the load balancer node in us\-west\-2a fills, resulting in spillover\. If us\-west\-2b continues to respond normally, the sum for the load balancer will be the same as the sum for us\-west\-2a\.  | 
| SurgeQueueLength |  The total number of requests \(HTTP listener\) or connections \(TCP listener\) that are pending routing to a healthy instance\. The maximum size of the queue is 1,024\. Additional requests or connections are rejected when the queue is full\. For more information, see `SpilloverCount`\. **Reporting criteria**: There is a nonzero value\.  **Statistics**: The most useful statistic is `Maximum`, because it represents the peak of queued requests\. The `Average` statistic can be useful in combination with `Minimum` and `Maximum` to determine the range of queued requests\. Note that `Sum` is not useful\. **Example**: Suppose that your load balancer has us\-west\-2a and us\-west\-2b enabled, and that instances in us\-west\-2a are experiencing high latency and are slow to respond to requests\. As a result, the surge queue for the load balancer nodes in us\-west\-2a fills, with clients likely experiencing increased response times\. If this continues, the load balancer will likely have spillovers \(see the `SpilloverCount` metric\)\. If us\-west\-2b continues to respond normally, the `max` for the load balancer will be the same as the `max` for us\-west\-2a\.  | 
| UnHealthyHostCount |  The number of unhealthy instances registered with your load balancer\. An instance is considered unhealthy after it exceeds the unhealthy threshold configured for health checks\. An unhealthy instance is considered healthy again after it meets the healthy threshold configured for health checks\. **Reporting criteria**: There are registered instances **Statistics**: The most useful statistics are `Average` and `Minimum`\. These statistics are determined by the load balancer nodes\. Note that some load balancer nodes might determine that an instance is unhealthy for a brief period while other nodes determine that it is healthy\. **Example**: See `HealthyHostCount`\.  | 

<a name="estimated-metrics"></a>The following metrics enable you to estimate your costs if you migrate a Classic Load Balancer to an Application Load Balancer\. These metrics are intended for informational use only, not for use with CloudWatch alarms\. Note that if your Classic Load Balancer has multiple listeners, these metrics are aggregated across the listeners\.

These estimates are based on a load balancer with one default rule and a certificate that is 2K in size\. If you use a certificate that is 4K or greater in size, we recommend that you estimate your costs as follows: create an Application Load Balancer based on your Classic Load Balancer using the migration tool and monitor the `ConsumedLCUs` metric for the Application Load Balancer\. For more information, see [Migrate from a Classic Load Balancer to an Application Load Balancer](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/migrate-to-application-load-balancer.html) in the *Elastic Load Balancing User Guide*\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| EstimatedALBActiveConnectionCount |  The estimated number of concurrent TCP connections active from clients to the load balancer and from the load balancer to targets\.  | 
| EstimatedALBConsumedLCUs |  The estimated number of load balancer capacity units \(LCU\) used by an Application Load Balancer\. You pay for the number of LCUs that you use per hour\. For more information, see [Elastic Load Balancing Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/pricing/)\.  | 
| EstimatedALBNewConnectionCount |  The estimated number of new TCP connections established from clients to the load balancer and from the load balancer to targets\.  | 
| EstimatedProcessedBytes |  The estimated number of bytes processed by an Application Load Balancer\.  |
