| CloudWatch Container Insights is in open preview\. The preview is open to all AWS accounts and you do not need to request access\. Features may be added or changed before announcing General Availability\. Donâ€™t hesitate to contact us with any feedback or let us know if you would like to be informed when updates are made by emailing us at [containerinsightsfeedback@amazon\.com](mailto:containerinsightsfeedback@amazon.com) | 

The following table lists the metrics and dimensions that Container Insights collects for Amazon EKS and Kubernetes\. These metrics are in the `ContainerInsights` namespace\. For more information, see [Metrics](cloudwatch_concepts.md#Metric)\.

If you do not see any Container Insights metrics in your console, be sure that you have completed the setup of Container Insights\. Metrics will not appear before Container Insights has been set up completely\. For more information, see [Setting Up Container Insights](deploy-container-insights.md)\.
