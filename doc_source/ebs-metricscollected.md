## Amazon EBS Metrics<a name="ebs-metrics"></a>

Amazon Elastic Block Store \(Amazon EBS\) sends data points to CloudWatch for several metrics\. Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD \(gp2\), Throughput Optimized HDD \(st1\) , Cold HDD \(sc1\), and Magnetic \(standard\) volumes automatically send five\-minute metrics to CloudWatch\. Provisioned IOPS SSD \(io1\) volumes automatically send one\-minute metrics to CloudWatch\. Data is only reported to CloudWatch when the volume is attached to an instance\. For more information about how to monitor Amazon EBS, see [Monitoring the Status of Your Volumes](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-volume-status.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

The `AWS/EBS` namespace includes the following metrics\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `VolumeReadBytes` `VolumeWriteBytes`  |  Provides information on the I/O operations in a specified period of time\. The `Sum` statistic reports the total number of bytes transferred during the period\. The `Average` statistic reports the average size of each I/O operation during the period, except on volumes attached to C5 instances, where the average represents the average over the specified period\. The `SampleCount` statistic reports the total number of I/O operations during the period, except on volumes attached to C5 instances, where the sample count represents the number of data points used in the statistical calculation\. Data is reported to CloudWatch only when the volume has I/O activity\. The `Minimum` and `Maximum` statistics on this metric are supported only by volumes attached to a C5 instance\. Units: Bytes  | 
|  `VolumeReadOps` `VolumeWriteOps`  |  The total number of I/O operations in a specified period of time\. To calculate the average I/O operations per second \(IOPS\) for the period, divide the total operations in the period by the number of seconds in that period\. The `Minimum` and `Maximum` statistics on this metric are supported only by volumes attached to a C5 or M5 instance\. Units: Count  | 
|  `VolumeTotalReadTime` `VolumeTotalWriteTime`  |  The total number of seconds spent by all operations that completed in a specified period of time\. If multiple requests are submitted at the same time, this total could be greater than the length of the period\. For example, for a period of 5 minutes \(300 seconds\): if 700 operations completed during that period, and each operation took 1 second, the value would be 700 seconds\. Data is reported to CloudWatch only when the volume has I/O activity\.  The `Average` statistic on this metric is not relevant for volumes attached to C5 instances\. The `Minimum` and `Maximum` statistics on this metric are supported only by volumes attached to a C5 instance\. Units: Seconds  | 
|  `VolumeIdleTime`  |  The total number of seconds in a specified period of time when no read or write operations were submitted\. The `Average` statistic on this metric is not relevant for volumes attached to C5 and M5 instances\. The `Minimum` and `Maximum` statistics on this metric are supported only by volumes attached to a C5 or M5 instance\. Units: Seconds  | 
|  `VolumeQueueLength`  |  The number of read and write operation requests waiting to be completed in a specified period of time\. The `Sum` statistic on this metric is not relevant for volumes attached to C5 and M5 instances\. The `Minimum` and `Maximum` statistics on this metric are supported only by volumes attached to a C5 or M5 instance\. Units: Count  | 
|  `VolumeThroughputPercentage`  |  Used with Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes only\. The percentage of I/O operations per second \(IOPS\) delivered of the total IOPS provisioned for an Amazon EBS volume\. Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes deliver within 10 percent of the provisioned IOPS performance 99\.9 percent of the time over a given year\. During a write, if there are no other pending I/O requests in a minute, the metric value will be 100 percent\. Also, a volume's I/O performance may become degraded temporarily due to an action you have taken \(for example, creating a snapshot of a volume during peak usage, running the volume on a non\-EBS\-optimized instance, or accessing data on the volume for the first time\)\. Units: Percent  | 
|  `VolumeConsumedReadWriteOps`  |  Used with Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes only\. The total amount of read and write operations \(normalized to 256K capacity units\) consumed in a specified period of time\. I/O operations that are smaller than 256K each count as 1 consumed IOPS\. I/O operations that are larger than 256K are counted in 256K capacity units\. For example, a 1024K I/O would count as 4 consumed IOPS\. Units: Count  | 
| `BurstBalance` |  Used with General Purpose SSD \(`gp2`\), Throughput Optimized HDD \(`st1`\), and Cold HDD \(`sc1`\) volumes only\. Provides information about the percentage of I/O credits \(for `gp2`\) or throughput credits \(for `st1` and `sc1`\) remaining in the burst bucket\. Data is reported to CloudWatch only when the volume is active\. If the volume is not attached, no data is reported\. The `Sum` statistic on this metric is not relevant for volumes attached to C5 and M5 instances\. Units: Percent  | 

## Dimensions for Amazon EBS Metrics<a name="ebs-metric-dimensions"></a>

The only dimension that Amazon EBS sends to CloudWatch is `VolumeId`\. All available statistics are filtered by `VolumeId`\.
