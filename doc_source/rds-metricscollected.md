## Amazon RDS Metrics<a name="rds-metrics"></a>

The `AWS/RDS` namespace includes the following metrics\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| BinLogDiskUsage |  The amount of disk space occupied by binary logs on the master\. Applies to MySQL read replicas\. Units: Bytes  | 
| BurstBalance |  The percent of General Purpose SSD \(gp2\) burst\-bucket I/O credits available\.  Units: Percent  | 
| CPUUtilization |  The percentage of CPU utilization\. Units: Percent  | 
| CPUCreditUsage |  \[T2 instances\] The number of CPU credits spent by the instance for CPU utilization\. One CPU credit equals one vCPU running at 100% utilization for one minute or an equivalent combination of vCPUs, utilization, and time \(for example, one vCPU running at 50% utilization for two minutes or two vCPUs running at 25% utilization for two minutes\)\. CPU credit metrics are available at a five\-minute frequency only\. If you specify a period greater than five minutes, use the `Sum` statistic instead of the `Average` statistic\. Units: Credits \(vCPU\-minutes\)  | 
| CPUCreditBalance |  \[T2 instances\] The number of earned CPU credits that an instance has accrued since it was launched or started\. For T2 Standard, the `CPUCreditBalance` also includes the number of launch credits that have been accrued\. Credits are accrued in the credit balance after they are earned, and removed from the credit balance when they are spent\. The credit balance has a maximum limit, determined by the instance size\. Once the limit is reached, any new credits that are earned are discarded\. For T2 Standard, launch credits do not count towards the limit\. The credits in the `CPUCreditBalance` are available for the instance to spend to burst beyond its baseline CPU utilization\. When an instance is running, credits in the `CPUCreditBalance` do not expire\. When the instance stops, the `CPUCreditBalance` does not persist, and all accrued credits are lost\. CPU credit metrics are available at a five\-minute frequency only\. Units: Credits \(vCPU\-minutes\)  | 
| DatabaseConnections |  The number of database connections in use\. Units: Count  | 
| DiskQueueDepth |  The number of outstanding IOs \(read/write requests\) waiting to access the disk\. Units: Count  | 
| FreeableMemory |  The amount of available random access memory\. Units: Bytes  | 
| FreeStorageSpace |  The amount of available storage space\. Units: Bytes  | 
| MaximumUsedTransactionIDs |  The maximum transaction ID that has been used\. Applies to PostgreSQL\. Units: Count  | 
| NetworkReceiveThroughput |  The incoming \(Receive\) network traffic on the DB instance, including both customer database traffic and Amazon RDS traffic used for monitoring and replication\. Units: Bytes/second  | 
| NetworkTransmitThroughput |  The outgoing \(Transmit\) network traffic on the DB instance, including both customer database traffic and Amazon RDS traffic used for monitoring and replication\. Units: Bytes/second  | 
| OldestReplicationSlotLag |  The lagging size of the replica lagging the most in terms of WAL data received\. Applies to PostgreSQL\. Units: Megabytes  | 
| ReadIOPS |  The average number of disk read I/O operations per second\. Units: Count/Second  | 
| ReadLatency |  The average amount of time taken per disk I/O operation\. Units: Seconds  | 
| ReadThroughput |  The average number of bytes read from disk per second\. Units: Bytes/Second  | 
| ReplicaLag |  The amount of time a Read Replica DB instance lags behind the source DB instance\. Applies to MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL Read Replicas\. Units: Seconds  | 
| ReplicationSlotDiskUsage |  The disk space used by replication slot files\. Applies to PostgreSQL\. Units: Megabytes  | 
| SwapUsage |  The amount of swap space used on the DB instance\. This metric is not available for SQL Server\. Units: Bytes  | 
| TransactionLogsDiskUsage |  The disk space used by transaction logs\. Applies to PostgreSQL\. Units: Megabytes  | 
| TransactionLogsGeneration |  The size of transaction logs generated per second\. Applies to PostgreSQL\. Units: Megabytes/second  | 
| WriteIOPS |  The average number of disk write I/O operations per second\. Units: Count/Second  | 
| WriteLatency |  The average amount of time taken per disk I/O operation\. Units: Seconds  |

Unlike for other DB engines, for Aurora DB instances this metric reports the amount of storage available to each DB instance for temporary tables and logs\. This value depends on the DB instance class \(for pricing information, see the [Amazon RDS product page](http://aws.amazon.com/rds/#pricing)\)\. You can increase the amount of free storage space for an instance by choosing a larger DB instance class for your instance\.  | Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL |

If this value reaches 2,146,483,648 \(2^31 \- 1,000,000\), the database is forced into read\-only mode, to avoid transaction ID wraparound\. For more information, see [Preventing Transaction ID Wraparound Failures](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/routine-vacuuming.html#VACUUM-FOR-WRAPAROUND) in the PostgreSQL documentation\.  | Aurora PostgreSQL |

| `VolumeBytesUsed` |  The amount of storage used by your Aurora DB instance, in bytes\. This value affects the cost of the Aurora DB cluster \(for pricing information, see the [Amazon RDS product page](http://aws.amazon.com/rds/#pricing)\)\.  | Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL | 
|  `VolumeReadIOPs`  |  The number of billed read I/O operations from a cluster volume, reported at 5\-minute intervals\. Billed read operations are calculated at the cluster volume level, aggregated from all instances in the Aurora DB cluster, and then reported at 5\-minute intervals\. The value is calculated by taking the value of the **Read operations** metric over a 5\-minute period\. You can determine the amount of billed read operations per second by taking the value of the **Billed read operations** metric and dividing by 300 seconds\. For example, if the **Billed read operations** returns 13,686, then the billed read operations per second is 45 \(13,686 / 300 = 45\.62\)\.  You accrue billed read operations for queries that request database pages that aren't in the buffer cache and therefore must be loaded from storage\. You might see spikes in billed read operations as query results are read from storage and then loaded into the buffer cache\.   | Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL | 
|  `VolumeWriteIOPs`  |  The number of write disk I/O operations to the cluster volume, reported at 5\-minute intervals\. See the description of VolumeReadIOPS above for a detailed description of how billed write operations are calculated\.  | Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL | 
|  `WriteIOPS`  |  The average number of disk I/O operations per second\.  Aurora PostgreSQL reports read and write IOPS separately, on 1\-minute intervals\.  | Aurora PostgreSQL | 
|  `WriteLatency`  |  The average amount of time taken per disk I/O operation\.  | Aurora PostgreSQL | 
|  `WriteThroughput`  |  The average number of bytes written to disk per second\.  | Aurora PostgreSQL |
