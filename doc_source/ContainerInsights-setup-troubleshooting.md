The following sections can help if you're having trouble setting up Container Insights\.

If your deployment fails with the error `Unauthorized panic: Cannot retrieve cadvisor data from kubelet`, your kubelet might not have Webhook authorization mode enabled\. This mode is required for Container Insights\. For more information, see [Verify Prerequisites](Container-Insights-prerequisites.md)\.
