# Install the CloudWatch Agent on an On\-Premises Server<a name="install-CloudWatch-Agent-on-premise"></a>

When you first start using CloudWatch agent, you download it to a server and configure the agent\. You can then use the agent with that configuration directly on that server\. If you save the configuration in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, you can also use the same configuration when you install the CloudWatch agent on other servers\.
