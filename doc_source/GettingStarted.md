# Getting Started with Amazon CloudWatch<a name="GettingStarted"></a>

The following scenarios show you how to use Amazon CloudWatch\. In the first scenario, you use the CloudWatch console to create a billing alarm that tracks your AWS usage and lets you know when you have exceeded a certain spending threshold\. In the second, more advanced scenario, you use the AWS command line interface \(CLI\) to publish a single metric for a hypothetical application named *GetStarted*\.
