# Viewing Container Insights Metrics<a name="Container-Insights-view-metrics"></a>

| CloudWatch Container Insights is in open preview\. The preview is open to all AWS accounts and you do not need to request access\. Features may be added or changed before announcing General Availability\. Donâ€™t hesitate to contact us with any feedback or let us know if you would like to be informed when updates are made by emailing us at [containerinsightsfeedback@amazon\.com](mailto:containerinsightsfeedback@amazon.com) | 

After you have Container Insights set up and it's collecting metrics, you can view those metrics on the CloudWatch automatic dashboards\.

**To view Container Insights metrics**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. In the upper left of the screen, select the down arrow next to **Overview** and choose **Container Insights**\.

   Several graphs appear, displaying metrics about your clusters\. Below the graphs is a list of clusters, with health and basic metrics shown for each one\.

   To filter the view to a certain cluster, use the box at the top in the middle\. 

1. At the top left, where it shows **Clusters**, switch to see metrics at the node, pod, service, and namespace levels\. When you do so, you can also filter those views to look only at individual pods and nodes\.

1. In any graph, hover over a legend line to see more information about that resource\.

You can set a CloudWatch alarm on any metric that Container Insights collects\. For more information, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch Alarms](AlarmThatSendsEmail.md)

## Using CloudWatch Logs Insights to View Container Insights Data<a name="Container-Insights-CloudWatch-Logs-Insights"></a>

Container Insights collects metrics by using performance log events, which are stored in CloudWatch Logs\. You can use CloudWatch Logs Insights queries for additional views of your container data\.

For more information about CloudWatch Logs Insights, see [Analyze Log Data with CloudWatch Logs Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html)\. For more information about the log fields you can use in queries, see [Relevant Fields in Performance Log Events](Container-Insights-reference-performance-entries.md)\.

**To use CloudWatch Logs Insights to query your container metric data**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Insights**\.

   Near the top of the screen is the query editor\. When you first open CloudWatch Logs Insights, this box contains a default query that returns the 20 most recent log events\.

1. In the box above the query editor, select one of the Container Insights log groups to query\. For the following example queries to work, the log group name must end with **performance**\.

   When you select a log group, CloudWatch Logs Insights automatically detects fields in the data in the log group and displays them in **Discovered fields** in the right pane\. It also displays a bar graph of log events in this log group over time\. This bar graph shows the distribution of events in the log group that matches your query and time range, not just the events displayed in the table\.

1. In the query editor, replace the default query with the following query and choose **Run query**\.

   ```
   STATS avg(node_cpu_utilization) as avg_node_cpu_utilization by NodeName
   | SORT avg_node_cpu_utilization DESC
   ```

   This query shows a list of nodes, sorted by average node CPU utilization\.

1. To try another example, replace that query with the following and choose **Run query**\.

   ```
   STATS avg(number_of_container_restarts) as avg_number_of_container_restarts by PodName
   | SORT avg_number_of_container_restarts DESC
   ```

   This query displays a list of your pods, sorted by average number of container restarts\.

1. If you want to try another query, you can use include fields in the list at the right of the screen\. For more information about query syntax, see [CloudWatch Logs Insights Query Syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_QuerySyntax.html)\.
